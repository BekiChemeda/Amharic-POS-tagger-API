# 🇪🇹 Amharic POS Tagger API

Hey there! Welcome to the Amharic Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagger API. This project is designed to help you analyze Amharic text by identifying the grammatical roles of each word (like Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, etc.) using a pre-trained CRF model.

I have built this with **FastAPI** to keep it snappy and modular, making it super easy for you to integrate into your own projects!

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your Environment
First things first, make sure you have Python installed. Then, grab the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start It Up!
You can start the server with a simple command:

```bash
python -m app.main
```
The server will start running at `http://localhost:8000`.

## 🛠 Features

- **Blazing Fast predictions** using a tuned CRF model.
- **Rate Limiting** built-in (via `slowapi`) to keep things fair and stable.
- **Modular Structure** following industry best practices.
- **Auto-generated Documentation**: Just head over to `/docs` once the server is running.

To ensure everyone gets a fair share of resources, we've set a default limit of **20 requests per minute**. If you hit this limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
